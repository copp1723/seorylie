We need to craft a brand-new file named CRITICAL_FIXES_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md.  
Content must:

• Describe each critical fix implemented in previous messages:  
  1. Migration renumbering (0010*).  
  2. RLS migration (0011*).  
  3. Auth-bypass safeguard in authentication middleware.  
  4. Production safety checks module + integration into server/index.ts.  
  5. Helper scripts (fix-duplicate-migrations.ts, test-row-level-security.ts).

• Explain what problem each fix solves.

• Provide CLEAR step-by-step deployment instructions (local dev & prod): run script, apply migrations, rebuild containers, env var changes, etc.

• Provide testing/validation steps: run RLS test script, run fix script, start server, observe auth-bypass safety, check health endpoints, etc.

• Keep markdown well-structured with headings, tables, code blocks (not fenced but indented inside facFileContent). Must respect no triple backticks rule? It says only actual content in facFileContent, triple backticks fine inside. The guideline just forbids wrapping whole file in ```; inside content we can still use fenced code. Usually allowed. I will include fenced code.

Return single facFileContent section.
