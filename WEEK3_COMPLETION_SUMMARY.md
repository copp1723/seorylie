# Week 3 Completion Summary: SEOWerks Manual Work Queue

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Extensions
- Extended `tasks` table with queue management fields (claimed_by, claimed_at, etc.)
- Created `deliverables` table for future file tracking
- Added `activity_logs` table for audit trail
- Created optimized `seowerks_queue_view` for efficient queries

### 2. Backend API Development
- **Queue Management Routes** (`/server/routes/admin-seowerks-queue.ts`):
  - GET /api/admin/seowerks-queue - Fetch tasks with filtering
  - POST /api/admin/seowerks-queue/:id/claim - Claim a task
  - POST /api/admin/seowerks-queue/:id/complete - Mark task complete
  - POST /api/admin/seowerks-queue/:id/unclaim - Release a task
  - GET /api/admin/seowerks-queue/stats - Queue statistics
- **Security**: Role-based middleware ensuring only SEOWerks team can access
- **Activity Logging**: All actions are tracked in activity_logs

### 3. Frontend Dashboard
- **SEOWerks Queue Dashboard** (`/client/src/pages/admin/seowerks-queue.tsx`):
  - Priority-based task display (Platinum > Gold > Silver)
  - Real-time updates every 30 seconds
  - Advanced filtering (status, type, search)
  - Task claiming workflow with modal details
  - Task completion marking
  - Statistics cards for queue metrics
- **Navigation**: Added to admin menu for SEOWerks team members

### 4. Integration
- Routes registered in main server
- Added to React Router configuration
- Sidebar navigation updated with role checks

## 🔄 Current State

The SEOWerks Manual Work Queue is now functional with:
- Task visibility prioritized by package tier
- Claim/complete workflow for team members
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Complete audit trail
- Secure role-based access

## 📋 Remaining Work (Week 5)

### Deliverable Processing Pipeline:
1. **File Upload System**:
   - Add file upload to task completion flow
   - Store original files in Supabase storage
   - Track file metadata in deliverables table

2. **Branding Processor**:
   - Service to strip SEOWerks branding from files
   - Apply agency-specific branding
   - Generate processed versions

3. **Agency Download Portal**:
   - New page for agencies to view completed work
   - Filtered view of their deliverables
   - Download functionality with permissions

4. **Storage Organization**:
   - Bucket structure: /agency-id/dealership-id/task-type/files
   - Version control for deliverables
   - Cleanup policies for old files

## 💡 Architecture Notes

The system follows a clear separation:
- **SEOWerks Side**: Queue management, task completion, file upload
- **Agency Side**: View only access to completed, branded deliverables
- **Middleware Layer**: RylieSEO handles the branding transformation

This maintains the white-label nature where agencies never see SEOWerks branding.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test the queue system with sample data
2. Create SEOWerks team user accounts
3. Generate test tasks through onboarding
4. Begin Week 5 deliverable processing implementation
