# GitHub Project Board Setup Instructions

## Project Details
- **Name**: "Seorylie Quality Improvements"
- **Repository**: copp1723/seorylie
- **Purpose**: Track improvements across Testing & CI, Code Quality, and Performance based on baseline audit

## Manual Setup Steps

### 1. Create Project Board
1. Go to https://github.com/copp1723/seorylie
2. Click on "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Select "Board" template
5. Name: "Seorylie Quality Improvements"
6. Description: "Track improvements across Testing & CI, Code Quality, and Performance focus areas based on baseline audit results."

### 2. Create Custom Swimlanes

#### Swimlane 1: Testing & CI
**Column Name**: `Testing & CI`
**Tasks to add**:
- [ ] Setup Jest testing framework
- [ ] Add unit tests for API endpoints  
- [ ] Configure coverage reporting
- [ ] Setup GitHub Actions CI
- [ ] Add integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Add E2E tests for critical user flows

#### Swimlane 2: Code Quality
**Column Name**: `Code Quality`

**Column Name**: `Performance`
**Tasks to add**:
- [ ] Fix server stability issues
- [ ] Complete load testing baseline  
- [ ] Add API response time monitoring
- [ ] Build frontend dashboard for Lighthouse analysis
- [ ] Setup performance CI checks
- [ ] Monitor database query performance

### 3. Configure Automation (Optional)
- Link issues to project items
- Set up automation rules for moving cards
- Configure project views and filters

### 4. Issue Templates
Create issue templates for each focus area with proper labels:
- `enhancement`, `testing`, `quality`, `performance`

## Alternative CLI Setup
If GitHub CLI is configured:
```bash
# Authenticate first
gh auth login

# Create project
gh project create --title "Seorylie Quality Improvements" --owner "@me"

# Add issues (after creating them)
gh issue create --title "Setup Jest testing framework" --label "testing,enhancement"
gh issue create --title "Configure ESLint + Prettier" --label "quality,enhancement"  
gh issue create --title "Fix server stability issues" --label "performance,bug"
```

## Project URL
Once created, the project will be available at:
`https://github.com/users/copp1723/projects/[PROJECT_NUMBER]`

## Integration with Baseline
This project board will track all improvements made from the baseline established in branch `analysis/baseline-audit-20250620`. Each completed task should reference the baseline metrics for progress measurement.
