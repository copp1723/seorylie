# API Performance Baseline Report (Autocannon)
Generated: $(date)
Project: Seorylie

## Testing Status: Server Connection Issues

### Issue Encountered:
- Server appears to have stopped during testing
- Connection refused on localhost:10000
- Both /health and /api endpoints unreachable

### Baseline Performance Metrics:
- **Target Endpoints**: /health, /api
- **Concurrency**: 10 connections
- **Duration**: 30 seconds planned
- **Results**: Unable to complete due to connection issues

### Error Details:
```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 10000
autocannon: 103k errors (0 timeouts)
```

### Recommended Performance Baseline Setup:
1. **Health Endpoint (/health)**:
   - Target: <200ms response time
   - Throughput: >1000 req/sec
   - P99 latency: <500ms

2. **API Endpoint (/api)**:
   - Target: <300ms response time  
   - Throughput: >500 req/sec
   - P99 latency: <1000ms

### Next Steps for Performance Testing:
1. Ensure stable server deployment
2. Re-run autocannon with consistent server state
3. Add monitoring during load testing
4. Test with various payload sizes
5. Monitor database connection pool under load

### Performance Testing Configuration:
```bash
# Health endpoint
npx autocannon -c 10 -d 30 -j http://localhost:10000/health

# API endpoint  
npx autocannon -c 10 -d 30 -j http://localhost:10000/api

# Higher load testing
npx autocannon -c 50 -d 60 -j http://localhost:10000/health
```
