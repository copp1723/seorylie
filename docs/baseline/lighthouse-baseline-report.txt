# Lighthouse Baseline Report
Generated: $(date)
Project: Seorylie

## Lighthouse Analysis Status: Not Applicable

### Issue:
Both /health and /api endpoints serve JSON/text content rather than HTML:
- `/health` returns JSON (application/json)
- `/api` returns JSON (text/plain)

### Lighthouse Error:
"The page provided is not HTML (served as MIME type application/json)"

### Frontend Analysis Needed:
1. Check if project has a web frontend interface
2. Identify HTML-serving endpoints for proper Lighthouse analysis
3. Consider building a frontend dashboard for the API

### Alternative Performance Testing:
- Using autocannon for API endpoint performance benchmarking
- Focus on API response times and throughput metrics
- Monitor JSON payload sizes and parsing performance

### Recommendations:
1. Add HTML frontend interface for comprehensive Lighthouse analysis  
2. Use API-specific performance tools (autocannon, ab, wrk)
3. Monitor Core Web Vitals if/when frontend is added
4. Consider lighthouse-ci for future frontend performance monitoring
