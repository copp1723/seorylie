# INT-015 Completion Summary ‚Äì Legacy Branch Cleanup & Repository Re-Org

\*Release candidate: **v1.0-rc1\***

---

## 1. Executive Summary

INT-015 successfully removed obsolete feature branches, archived historical work, and formalised a new three-tier branching model. The cleanup eliminates dead code paths, reduces merge noise, and positions **CleanRylie** for stable, fast-forward releases from _golden_ to _main_.

---

## 2. Technical Implementation Details

- **Automation script:** `scripts/branch-cleanup.ts`
  - Type-safe TSX CLI with Commander/Inquirer.
  - Verifies current branch, protected lists, merge status (`git --cherry-pick`).
  - Supports `--dry-run`, `--interactive`, `--verify-integration`, `--report-only`, `--force`.
- **Categorisation logic:** Regex patterns (`C* | H* | I* | U* | T*`) + protected lists.
- **Archiving:** `git format-patch` ‚Üí ZIP (`archiver`) + metadata JSON; rollback commands auto-generated.
- **Reporting:** JSON + Markdown artefacts written to `.branch-archives/`.

- Stored under `.branch-archives/`; nightly S3 sync via existing backup job.
- Rollback instructions embedded in report.

---

## 6. Updated Branching Strategy

- Documented in `docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md`.
- Model: **main ‚Üí golden ‚Üí integration ‚Üí short-lived feature branches**.

  - `.github/workflows/integration-quality-gate.yml`
- Added branch-name matrix testing for `feat/*` hotfix exceptions.

---

## 8. README Updates

- Added v1.0-rc1 banner, new branch diagram, quality metrics block, deployment checklist.
- Deprecation note for legacy branches appended.

---

## 9. Developer Workflow & On-Boarding Changes

- No pending PRs or divergent feature work.
- Deployment manifests reference integration SHA `fbf45ee7`.

---

## 12. Quality Gates & Deployment Preparation

- Quality Gate workflow green (type-check, lint, unit, integration, E2E, build).
- Security scan: **0 critical, 0 high** vulnerabilities.
- Docker images built & passed health checks in staging cluster.

---

## 15. Migration Guidance for Development Teams

- **Stop using** `C*/H*/U*/T*` legacy branch prefixes.
- Re-create ongoing work:
  ```bash
  git fetch --prune
  git checkout -b feat/INT-016-awesome-feature integration/production-readiness-phase1
  ```
