## 🔧 Quality Gates Validation

### 1. Dependencies & Setup
```bash
npm run setup                    # ✅ PASSED - All dependencies installed
./scripts/pre-check.sh          # ✅ PASSED - Pre-check script created
npm run setup:verify            # Run to verify environment
```

### 2. TypeScript Compilation
```bash
npm run check                   # Type checking
npm run lint                    # Linting rules
```

### 3. Testing Suite
```bash
npm run test                    # Unit tests
npm run test:integration        # Integration tests
npm run test:adf                # ADF pipeline tests
npm run test:e2e                # End-to-end tests
```

### 4. Build Process
```bash
npm run build                   # Production build
npm run build:check             # Build verification
```
