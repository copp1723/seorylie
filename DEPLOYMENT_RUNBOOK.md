## Deployment Automation

### Available Scripts

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
# Development
npm run dev                    # Start development server
npm run dev:enhanced          # Enhanced development mode

# Building
npm run build                 # Build for production
npm run start                # Start production server

# Testing
npm run test                  # Run test suite
npm run test:ci              # CI test with coverage
npm run test:adf             # ADF-specific tests

# Deployment
npm run deploy:staging       # Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:production    # Deploy to production
npm run deploy:check         # Pre-deployment readiness check
```

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

âœ… Automated readiness check available

**Required Checks:**
1. **Environment Variables**: All required env vars configured
2. **Database Health**: Migrations applied, connections working
3. **External Services**: API keys valid, services accessible
4. **Build Process**: Clean build without errors
5. **Test Suite**: All tests passing
6. **Dependencies**: No security vulnerabilities

**Manual Verification:**
```bash
npm run deploy:check           # Run automated checks
npm run health                # Verify health endpoints
npm run env:validate          # Check environment configuration
```

### Production Deployment Process

**Step 1: Pre-deployment**
```bash
# Backup current database
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Run readiness checks
npm run deploy:check
```

**Step 2: Deploy Application**
```bash
# Deploy to staging first
npm run deploy:staging

# Verify staging deployment
curl -f https://staging.cleanrylie.com/health

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production
```

**Step 3: Post-deployment Verification**
```bash
# Check health endpoints
npm run health

# Verify core functionality
npm run test:adf-e2e

# Monitor logs for errors
tail -f logs/application.log
```

### Rollback Procedures

**Automatic Rollback:**
- Health checks fail â†’ automatic rollback
- Error rate > 5% â†’ automatic rollback

**Manual Rollback:**
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
npm run deploy:production

# Database rollback if needed
npm run migrate:down
```

### Blue-Green Deployment

CleanRylie supports blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates:

1. **Green Environment**: Deploy new version to green environment
2. **Verification**: Run full test suite on green environment  
3. **Traffic Switch**: Gradually shift traffic from blue to green
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor metrics during traffic migration
5. **Cleanup**: Decommission blue environment after success

## Emergency Response Procedures

### Incident Classification

**P1 - Critical (< 15 min response)**
- Complete system outage
- Database corruption/loss
- Security breach
- Data integrity issues

**P2 - High (< 1 hour response)**
- Partial system outage
- Performance degradation > 10x normal
- External service failures
- Memory/disk space critical

**P3 - Medium (< 4 hours response)**
- Non-critical feature failures
- Monitoring alerts
- Performance degradation < 10x normal

### Emergency Contacts

**On-Call Rotation:**
- Primary: Engineering Team Lead
- Secondary: Platform Engineer
- Escalation: CTO/Technical Director

**External Vendors:**
- Database: PostgreSQL support
- Hosting: Cloud provider support
- Monitoring: Observability platform support

### Immediate Response Actions

**Step 1: Assessment (0-5 minutes)**
1. Check health endpoints: `curl /health`
2. Review recent deployments and changes
3. Check external service status pages
4. Verify monitoring dashboards

**Step 2: Containment (5-15 minutes)**
1. Stop affected services if necessary
2. Enable maintenance mode if available
3. Scale down problematic components
4. Isolate affected systems

**Step 3: Communication (15-30 minutes)**
1. Update status page with initial assessment
2. Notify stakeholders via established channels
3. Create incident tracking ticket
4. Schedule regular updates

### Common Emergency Scenarios

#### Database Connection Failures
```bash
# Check database status
pg_isready -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT

# Check connection pool
curl /api/health/db

# Emergency database restart
systemctl restart postgresql
```

#### Memory/CPU Exhaustion
```bash
# Check resource usage
top
df -h

# Restart application
npm run start

# Scale horizontally if possible
kubectl scale deployment/app --replicas=3
```

#### External API Failures
```bash
# Enable fallback mode

export EMAIL_PROVIDER=mailhog

# Restart with fallback configuration
npm run start
```
