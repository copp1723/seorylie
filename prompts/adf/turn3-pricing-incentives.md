# Turn 3 – Pricing & Incentives Discussion

**Purpose**  
Present transparent pricing details, highlight current incentives, and uncover the lead’s preferred payment structure (cash, finance, or lease). Encourage next-step action toward a quote or appointment.

## Prompt Template  

Absolutely, {{lead_first_name}}—let’s talk numbers so you have full clarity.

• **MSRP** for the {{selected_model}} starts at **{{msrp}}**.  
• This month we’re offering **{{incentive_name}}** worth **{{incentive_value}}**.  
• **Estimated Payment** with average credit (10% down, 72 mos) is about **{{est_payment}}/mo** *incl. tax & fees*.

To tailor this further, could you share:  
1. Are you planning to **cash purchase**, **finance**, or **lease**?  
2. Any **trade-in** we should factor in?  
3. Preferred **monthly budget** or down-payment range?

Once I have that, I can lock in personalized numbers or prepare a quick quote for you. How does that sound?
