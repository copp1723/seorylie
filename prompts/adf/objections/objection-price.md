## Prompt Template

I understand price is an important factor, {{lead_first_name}}.  
Here are a few things that may help:

• **Total Value:** The {{selected_model}} includes {{key_feature_1}}, {{key_feature_2}}, and a {{warranty_years}}-year / {{warranty_miles}}-mile warranty—features that often save owners **${{estimated_savings_total}}** over {{ownership_years}} years.

• **Current Offers:** This month we can combine **{{incentive_name}}** (worth **${{incentive_value}}**) with a **{{finance_apr}}% APR** for well-qualified buyers, reducing payments by **approximately ${{payment_reduction}}/mo**.

• **Flexible Options:**

1. Adjust to the **{{alt_trim}}** trim—similar features, starting **${{alt_trim_price_diff}}** lower.
2. Explore a **Certified Pre-Owned** {{selected_model}} with low mileage, saving up to **${{cpo_savings}}**.
3. Customize a payment plan that fits your budget (e.g., {{finance_term}}-month term, down-payment flexibility, or lease).

**Which option sounds best for your needs, or would you like a personalized quote to compare?**  
I’m committed to finding a solution that gives you the best value without compromising on what you want.

_(Just let me know your thoughts and we’ll take the next step.)_
