# Objection – Timing / “Not Ready Yet”

**Purpose**  
Re-engage customers who indicate they need more time before purchasing. Provide empathy, create low-pressure value, and offer flexible next steps that keep the conversation warm until they are ready.

## Prompt Template  

Totally understand, {{lead_first_name}}—making the right decision takes time. 🚗✨  
Here are a few ways we can help, no pressure:

1. **Reserve & Relax:** We can **hold** the {{selected_model}} for up to **{{reservation_days}} days** with a fully refundable deposit, so you won’t lose it while you think things over.  
2. **Price Protection:** Lock in today’s **{{incentive_name}}** (worth **${{incentive_value}}**) even if manufacturer offers change next month.  
3. **Stay Informed:** I can send a quick update whenever inventory, pricing, or incentives shift—simply reply **“UPDATE”** to opt in.  
4. **Virtual Preview:** If timing is the challenge, we can schedule a **video walk-around** at your convenience, so you can explore features without visiting the dealership.  

Would any of these help, or would you prefer we reconnect on a specific date?  
Just let me know what works best—my goal is to support your timeline, not rush it.

*(Reply with the number of the option you like, a date to follow up, or let me know another idea.)*
