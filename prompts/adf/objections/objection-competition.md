# Objection – Competitor Comparison

**Purpose**  
Reassure leads who are comparing offers from other dealerships or considering different brands. Emphasize unique value-adds, total cost of ownership, service excellence, and provide data-backed reasons to choose {{dealership_name}}.

## Prompt Template

I completely understand doing your homework, {{lead_first_name}}—it’s smart to compare options.  
Here are a few points that set **{{selected_model}} at {{dealership_name}}** apart:

| Advantage                      | {{selected_model}} @ {{dealership_name}}          | Typical Competitor        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Warranty                       | {{warranty_years}}-yr / {{warranty_miles}}-mi     | {{comp_warranty}}         |
| Maintenance                    | **{{free_maintenance_years}}-yr** complimentary   | ${{comp_maint_cost}} avg. |
| Incentives                     | {{incentive_name}} worth **${{incentive_value}}** | {{comp_incentive}}        |
| Total Cost of Ownership (5-yr) | **${{tco_5yr_us}}**                               | ${{comp_tco_us}}          |
| Customer Reviews               | {{dealer_rating}}★ ({{review_count}} reviews)     | {{comp_rating}}★          |

Beyond numbers, our guests tell us they choose {{dealership_name}} for:

• **VIP Service:** Shuttle, loaners, and lounge with Wi-Fi & snacks.  
• **Speed:** We complete paperwork **{{avg_paperwork_time}}% faster** than area dealers.  
• **Community:** Active supporter of {{local_charity}}—your purchase helps too.

**Would it help if I sent a side-by-side quote or scheduled a quick call to walk through the details?**  
My goal is transparency—so you can decide with confidence, even if that means another brand is the best fit for you.

_(Let me know what comparisons matter most to you, and I’ll pull the exact data.)_
