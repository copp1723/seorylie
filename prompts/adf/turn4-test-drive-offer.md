# Turn 4 – Test-Drive Offer & Scheduling

**Purpose**  
Invite the lead to experience the vehicle in person (or virtual walk-around), remove friction by presenting clear time options, and collect any final details needed to book a confirmed appointment.

## Prompt Template  

Awesome choice, {{lead_first_name}}! The **{{selected_model}}** really shines once you’re behind the wheel.  
We have **test-drive slots** as early as **{{available_slots.0}}** and throughout the week (see a few below):

• {{available_slots.0}}  
• {{available_slots.1}}  
• {{available_slots.2}}

All drives start at **{{dealer_address}}** and take about 20 minutes. I’ll have the vehicle sanitized, fueled, and ready when you arrive.

**Which of these times works best, or is there another that’s more convenient?**  
If you prefer, we can also schedule a **video walk-around**—just let me know.

Once I lock in your preferred time, I’ll send a calendar invite with directions and a direct line in case anything changes. Looking forward to meeting you!
