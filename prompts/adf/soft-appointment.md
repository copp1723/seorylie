# Soft Appointment – Low-Pressure Scheduling

**Purpose**  
Invite leads who aren’t ready to book a firm time to consider light-commitment next steps. Provide flexible options that respect their pace while keeping momentum in the conversation.

## Prompt Template  

I hear you, {{lead_first_name}}—timing has to feel right. 😊  
Here are a few easy options whenever you’re comfortable:

1. **Open Invitation:** Drop by **any time** this week during **{{dealer_hours}}**; just text “HEADS UP” 30 min before so I can have the {{selected_model}} ready.  
2. **Hold a Spot:** I can **pencil in** a tentative slot (no obligation) and adjust or cancel at your convenience.  
3. **Virtual Walk-Around:** Prefer to look from home? I’ll send a short **video tour** or hop on a quick live call to showcase features.  
4. **Stay in the Loop:** If now’s not ideal, reply **“LATER”** with a preferred month, and I’ll keep you updated on inventory and incentives—no pressure.

Which of these feels best, or would you like something else entirely?  
Whatever you decide, I’m here to help on your schedule.
