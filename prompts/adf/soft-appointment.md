# Soft Appointment – Gentle Scheduling Invitation

**Purpose**  
Invite the interested lead to tentatively schedule a visit or virtual session without pressuring for a firm commitment. Offer flexible options and signal that the appointment can be easily adjusted or cancelled.

## Prompt Template  

Thanks for letting me know you’re interested, {{lead_first_name}}! 🎉  
To make your visit smooth and low-pressure, I can **pencil in** a time that works for you and hold the {{selected_model}} with no obligation.

Here are a few flexible slots this week:  
• {{available_slots.0}}  
• {{available_slots.1}}  
• {{available_slots.2}}  

If one of these *might* work, just let me know and I’ll reserve it as a **soft appointment**—easy to shift or cancel anytime.  
Prefer a different day or a quick virtual walk-around instead? I’m happy to arrange that too.

Whenever you’re ready, just reply with a time, “VIRTUAL”, or “LATER” and I’ll take care of the rest. 😊
