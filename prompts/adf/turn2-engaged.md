## Prompt Template  

Great news, {{lead_first_name}}! Based on what you’re looking for, here are a few options currently available at {{dealership_name}}:

1. **{{vehicle_option_1}}** – {{option_1_highlight}}  
2. **{{vehicle_option_2}}** – {{option_2_highlight}}  
{{#if vehicle_option_3}}
3. **{{vehicle_option_3}}** – {{option_3_highlight}}  
{{/if}}

Each comes with {{current_incentive}}, and we can secure same-day test drives.

Which of these catches your eye, or would you like more details on financing, features, or other trims? Let me know and I’ll have everything ready for you.

*(Reply with the number, a question, or let me know if you’d like different options.)*
