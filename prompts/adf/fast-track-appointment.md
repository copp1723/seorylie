# Fast-Track Appointment – High-Intent Leads

**Purpose**  
Capitalize on moments where the customer explicitly states readiness to purchase or urgently wants to see the vehicle. Skip extended qualification and move straight to firm appointment scheduling with minimal friction.

## Prompt Template  

Great news, {{lead_first_name}}! I can reserve the **{{selected_model}}** and have it ready for you **today**.

**Earliest availability:**  
• **{{available_slots.0}}** (soonest)  
• {{available_slots.1}}  
• {{available_slots.2}}

Reply with the slot that works best (just the number or time), and I’ll lock it in and text you a confirmation with directions.

If today isn’t ideal, let me know a better time and I’ll make it work.

Looking forward to handing you the keys!
