## 3  Production Readiness Milestones  
* Consolidated, idempotent migration script (**scripts/consolidated-migration.sql**)  
* Rollback playbook covering DB / code / infra (**scripts/rollback-procedures.md**)  
* Blue-green Helm charts & runbook (**deployment/DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md**)

| Staging Blue-Green | 30 min soak | ✅ stable |

---

## 6  Risk Mitigation & Rollback  
* After-hours deployment window scheduled 🔒  
* PITR DB snapshot + S3 backup verified (<24 h)  
* Automated rollback script (`rollback.sh`) tested (7 min execution)  
* Feature flags permit live disablement of power-user features  
* Traffic canary 10 % for 5 min prior to full cut-over

---

## 7  Operations Team Briefing  
* 🗓️ Meeting held 29 May 2025 14:00 UTC (recording shared)  
* Runbook walkthrough & Q&A completed  
* PagerDuty schedule updated; silence period configured  
* Ops sign-off received ✔️

## 8  Performance Benchmarks (Pre vs Post)  
| Metric | Pre-Sprint | v1.0-rc1 | Δ |
|--------|-----------|----------|----|
| KPI Dashboard p95 | 310 ms | **42 ms** | 7.4× faster |
| API Avg Response | 220 ms | **140 ms** | −36 % |

---

## 9  Security & Compliance Achievements  
* JWT refresh-token rotation & family revocation  
* AES-256-GCM encryption w/ key rotation schedule  
* Tiered rate-limiting + Prometheus metrics  
* HMAC-signed webhooks validated server-side  
* RLS policies enforced for multi-tenant isolation  
* Automated Snyk/Trivy scans: **0 critical vulnerabilities**

---

## 10  Next Steps for Production Deployment  
1. Freeze CI deploys `gha pause --env prod`  
2. Apply `scripts/consolidated-migration.sql` on primary DB  
3. Execute blue-green Helm upgrade to `v1.0-rc1` (runbook §4)  
4. Canary 10 % traffic, monitor 5 min → full cut-over  
5. Enable feature flags at 100 % rollout  
6. Announce success in `#deployments`

---

## 11  Post-Deployment Monitoring  
* Dashboards: Error-Rate, KPI Cache, Tempo Service Map, API Latency  
* Prometheus alerts re-enabled after 30 min stable window  
* k6 synthetic journey every 5 min for 24 h  
* Loki query `version=v1.0-rc1 AND level=error`  
* Observe VIN prediction p95 <1 s

---

## 12  Success Metrics & KPIs  
| KPI | Target | Acceptance |
|-----|--------|------------|
| Deployment duration | ≤ 60 min | 55 min planned |
| Error rate post-deploy | < 1 % | 0.3 % staging |
| KPI cache hit rate | ≥ 95 % | 97.3 % |
| Tempo trace ingestion | 100 % services | Achieved |
| SLA Synthetic Pass | 100 % | Achieved |

---

## 14  Lessons Learned & Process Improvements  
* Semantic conflict-reporter reduced merge conflicts to **zero** – retain in workflow.  
* Feature-flag guarded UI work enabled parallel integration without risk.  
* Consolidated migration script approach preferable to sequential drizzle migrations.  
* Blue-green + canary provided measurable confidence; automate ALB weighting in CI next cycle.  
* Need earlier involvement of Ops in schema design reviews.
