# ✅ Onboarding → Task Flow Complete

## What I've Implemented

### 1. Automatic Task Creation
When someone completes the public onboarding form:
- **Database record created** in `seoworks_onboarding_submissions`
- **Dealership created** if it doesn't exist
- **Initial tasks generated** based on package:
  - PLATINUM: 5 tasks (landing pages, blogs, GBP posts, SEO audit)
  - GOLD: 5 tasks (optimized for mid-tier needs)
  - SILVER: 4 tasks (essential SEO setup)
- **Tasks prioritized** with staggered due dates
- **Activity logged** for audit trail

### 2. Email Notifications
Created comprehensive email service with:
- **Onboarding confirmation** to dealership
- **Team notification** to SEOWerks
- **Task completion** notifications
- **Deliverable ready** alerts
- **Weekly digest** functionality

### 3. Scheduled Processing
- **Cron job** runs every 5 minutes
- **Processes pending** onboardings automatically
- **Handles failures** gracefully
- **Logs all activity**

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/server/services/onboardingTaskCreator.ts` - Task creation logic
- `/server/services/emailService.ts` - Email notification system
- `/server/jobs/processOnboardings.ts` - Scheduled job processor
- `/scripts/test-email-service.ts` - Email testing utility

### Modified Files:
- `/server/routes/public-seoworks-onboarding.ts` - Added task creation
- `/server/index.ts` - Added scheduled job startup

## How It Works

```
Dealership Signup → Save to DB → Create Tasks → Send Emails → Add to Queue
                        ↓
                 If fails, retry via cron job
```
