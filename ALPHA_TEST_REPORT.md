## 🔧 Current Issues

### 1. Database Connection
**Issue:** Server reports database as "disconnected" in health check
**Impact:** Authentication and data-dependent APIs may fail
**Solution:** Verify PostgreSQL service and connection string

### 2. Route Resolution
**Issue:** Some API endpoints returning 404 errors
**Impact:** Test suite cannot validate full functionality
**Solution:** Server restart with database connection fix
